Portfolio valuation and risk analysis utilizing Correlation Matrix, Coariance Matrix, Monte Carlo Simulation, also created a Volatility Optimization Surface between energy and risk sector stocks.

When I first began creating this project in November of 2025, I wanted to model the "AI Boom" that we have been witnessing in the market. I currently have it modeling the last 5 years but it is customizable to show more recent movement.

I am expecting a high degree of correlation between the SemiCon industry and the Hyperscalers, but it will be interesting to see if there will be a divergence if Google decides to expand access to or sell their TPU's and the same applies to Amazon with their Trainium/Inferentia chips.

Looking at upcoming constraints in the global supply chain for AI infrastrucutre buildout, it was clear that NOR/NAND Flash and HBM prodcuers were poised to experience substantial growth in valuation. I left out some of the major players in the Flash memory world such as SK Hynik and chose to include Western Digital instead of Sandisk, as I was using 5 year historical data and Western Digital only spun Sandisk off in Feb of 2025. I believe optics is now poised to have a healthy year of growth alongside memory as companies begin to upgrade existing datacenter infrastructure, and will add portfolio content accordingly.

Energy is an obvious first-thinking choice to benefit from AI infra buildout, but I left out players such as Oklo and New Scale Power as they have not shipped any physical products. It may take years for the first Small Modular Reactor to come online but I do believe that is the future of energy generation.
